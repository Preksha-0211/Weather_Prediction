# Weather Prediction

## Project Overview

The Weather Prediction project leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast weather conditions based on historical data. By analyzing patterns in past weather data, the model predicts future weather scenarios, aiding in various applications such as agriculture planning, event management, and more.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Aggregates historical weather data from multiple sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares data for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to train predictive models.
- **Prediction**: Provides forecasts for future weather conditions.
